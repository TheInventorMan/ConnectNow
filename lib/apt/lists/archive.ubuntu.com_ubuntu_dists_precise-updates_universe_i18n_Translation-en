Package: amanda-client
Description-md5: 21af3684379a64cacc51c39152ab1062
Description-en: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

Package: apt-cacher-ng
Description-md5: b88e5e2d04c76e8d4500fb60880c7d76
Description-en: caching proxy server for software repositories
 Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy for downloading packages from Debian-style
 software repositories (or possibly from other types).
 .
 The main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local
 network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.
 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

 JCC is a code generator for producing a Python extension providing
 access to a set of Java classes. For every Java class, JCC generates
 a C++ wrapper class that hides the gory details necessary for
 accessing methods and fields from C++ via Java's Native Invocation
 Interface.  JCC can also generate C++ wrappers that make it possible
 to access these classes from Python.  When generating Python
 wrappers, JCC produces a complete Python extension via the distutils
 package that makes it readily available to the Python interpreter.
 JCC is a project maintained by the Open Source Applications
 Foundation.

 when two conditions are satisfied. First condition is that the remote client
 is actually a proxy that is defined in httpd.conf. Secondly if there is an
 incoming X-Forwarded-For header and the proxy is in its list of known
 proxies it takes the last IP from the incoming X-Forwarded-For header and
 changes the remote address of the client in the request structure.

 file without the need of a separate server process. It needs a separate lock
 manager -- fb_lock_mgr -- which is in firebird2.5-classic package.
 .
 If you are in doubt, you most probably need libfbclient2, instead of this
 package.

Package: lsb-invalid-mta
Description-md5: 0762ff4b414a40b4c2d1f9a1daf89fc3
Description-en: Linux Standard Base sendmail dummy
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package contains nothing else than a fake /usr/sbin/sendmail
 command to fulfill the LSB's requirement of providing this command without
 requiring an MTA to get installed, which once introduces a daemon which
 can cause security problems and second, users get asked questions about
 how they want their MTA configured when in reality they simply wanted to
 install a deskltop application or a printer driver, but the dependency on
 LSB compliance pulls in an MTA with the installation.
 .
 The LSB requirement on /usr/sbin/sendmail comes from old times where Linux
 and Unix machines had all fixed IPs and did server tasks in data centers.
 Today's typical desktop Linux machines do not do local e-mail any more as
 users use external e-mail services.
 .
 The /usr/sbin/sendmail always exits with exit status -1 (255) and sends a
 warning message to stderr, so that if a program actually tries to send e-mail
 via the sendmail command the user gets note.

Package: ruby-actionpack-2.3
Description-md5: bd654c15152645d5d4a028abca7edd92
Description-en: Controller and View framework used by Rails
 Action Pack splits the response to a requests into a controller part
 (performing the logic) and a view part (rendering a template). This
 two-step approach is known as an action, which will normally create,
 read, update, or delete (CRUD for short) some sort of model part
 (often backed by a database) before choosing either to render a
 template or redirecting to another action.
 .
 It eases web-request routing, handling, and response as a half-way
 front, half-way page controller. Implemented with specific emphasis
 on enabling easy unit/integration testing that doesn't require
 a browser.

Package: ruby-rvm
Description-md5: 7925ef851e1bb28ba0d4ce9e1cc1761c
Description-en: easily install, manage and work with multiple ruby environments
 RVM allows users to deploy each project with its own completely self-contained
 and dedicated environment - from the specific version of ruby all the way down
 to the precise set of required gems to run the application.
 .
 Having a precise set of gems also avoids the issue of version conflicts between
 projects, causing difficult-to-trace errors and hours of hair loss. With RVM,
 NO OTHER GEMS than those required are installed. This makes working with
 multiple complex applications where each has a long list of gem dependencies
 efficient.
 .
 RVM allows one to easily test gem upgrades by switching to a new clean set of
 gems to test with while leaving the original set intact. It is flexible enough
 to even have a set of gems per environment or development branch--or even
 individual developer's taste!

 .
 Ruby uses two parallel versioning schemes: the `Ruby library compatibility
 version' (1.9.1 for this package), which is similar to a library SONAME, and
 the `Ruby version' (1.9.3 for this package). Ruby packages in Debian are
 named using the Ruby library compatibility version, which is sometimes

Package: swift
Description-md5: 7de15bde951264e5f9603202d2a74a72
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

Package: vamp-examples
Description-md5: 52fe1c84a9c7e8722a5e9bf1c4a71f39
Description-en: example Vamp plugins and host
 Vamp is an audio processing plugin system for plugins that extract
 descriptive information from audio data - typically referred to as
 audio analysis plugins or audio feature extraction plugins.
 .
 This package contains the following example plugins:
 .
  * Zero Crossings calculates the positions and density of
    zero-crossing points in an audio waveform.
 .
  * Spectral Centroid calculates the centre of gravity of the
    frequency domain representation of each block of audio.
 .
  * Simple Power Spectrum calculates a power spectrum from the input
    audio.  Actually, it doesn't do any work except calculating power
    from a cartesian complex FFT output.  The work of calculating this
    frequency domain output is done for it by the host or host SDK; the
    plugin just needs to declare that it wants frequency domain
    input. This is the simplest of the example plugins.
 .
  * Amplitude Follower is an implementation of SuperCollider's
    amplitude-follower algorithm as a simple Vamp plugin.
 .
  * Simple Percussion Onset Detector: estimates the locations of
    percussive onsets using a simple method described in "Drum Source
    Separation using Percussive Feature Detection and Spectral
    Modulation" by Dan Barry, Derry Fitzgerald, Eugene Coyle and Bob
    Lawlor, ISSC 2005.
 .
  * Simple Fixed Tempo Estimator: calculates a single beats-per-minute
    value which is an estimate of the tempo of a piece of music that is
    assumed to be of fixed tempo, using autocorrelation of a frequency
    domain energy rise metric.  It has several outputs that return
    intermediate results used in the calculation, and may be a useful
    example of a plugin having several outputs with varying feature
    structures.
 .
 Also included is a simple host that can enumerate plugins, list their
 features, and process an audio file.

Package: vamp-plugin-sdk
Description-md5: c59403a310d84abae1f69ab106414eea
Description-en: audio analysis and feature extraction plugins (SDK)
 Vamp is an audio processing plugin system for plugins that extract
 descriptive information from audio data - typically referred to as
 audio analysis plugins or audio feature extraction plugins.
 .
 Just like an audio effects plugin (such as a VST), a Vamp plugin is a
 binary module that can be loaded up by a host application and fed
 audio data. However, unlike an effects plugin, a Vamp plugin outputs
 not processed audio but some sort of symbolic information. Typical
 things that a Vamp plugin might calculate include the locations of
 moments such as note onset times, visual representations of the audio
 such as histograms, or curve data such as power or fundamental
 frequency.
 .
 Hosts using Vamp plugins include Audacity and Sonic Visualiser.
 .
 This package contains C and C++ header files for developing Vamp
 plugins and hosts as well as source code of example plugins and a
 simple host and also a utility to generate Vamp plugin RDF templates.

Description-md5: 829bcfa57e4b5d520b5b4e141e3e6476
Description-en: Xen Hypervisor on i386
 The hypervisor is the "core" for XEN itself.  It gets booted by the boot
 loader and controls cpu and memory, sharing them between your
 administrative domain (Domain 0) and the virtual guest systems.
 .
 In order to boot a XEN system along with this package you also need a
 kernel specifically crafted to work as the Domain 0, mediating hardware
 access for XEN itself.
