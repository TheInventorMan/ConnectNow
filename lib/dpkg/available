Description: Package Discovery and Resource Access using pkg_resources
 The pkg_resources module provides an API for Python libraries to
 access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
 frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  It also provides
 runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
 eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
 modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
 "working set" of active packages.

Description: GNOME XML library
 XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.
 A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in
 a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your
 own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It
 can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard
 metalanguage for markup languages.
 .
 This package provides a library providing an extensive API to handle
 such XML data files.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: non-DNS IP-to-country resolver library
 GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any
 IP address or hostname originates from. It uses a file based database.
 .
 This database simply contains IP blocks as keys, and countries as values and
 it should be more complete and accurate than using reverse DNS lookups.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Update Configuration File: preserve user changes to config files.
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: fast and lightweight templating for the Python platform
 Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar, non-XML
 syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako's
 syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Django
 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
 Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
 componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most
 straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close
 ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.

Description: XML parsing C library - development kit
 This package contains the header file and development libraries of
 expat, the C library for parsing XML.  Expat is a stream oriented XML
 parser.  This means that you register handlers with the parser prior
 to starting the parse.  These handlers are called when the parser
 discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed.  A
 start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
 register handlers.

Description: Development files for MIT Kerberos without Heimdal conflict
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 Most users wishing to build applications against MIT Kerberos should
 install libkrb5-dev.  However, that package conflicts with heimdal-dev.
 This package installs libraries and headers in /usr/include/mit-krb5 and
 /usr/lib/mit-krb5 and can be installed along side heimdal-multidev, which
 provides the same facilities for Heimdal.

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is

 .
 It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
 explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
 automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be
 used.
 .
 This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
 defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
 replacement.

Description: Assemble multiple Regular Expressions into a single RE
 Regexp::Assemble takes an arbitrary number of regular expressions
 and assembles them into a single regular expression (or RE) that
 matches all that the individual REs match.
 .
 As a result, instead of having a large list of expressions to loop
 over, a target string only needs to be tested against one expression.
 This is interesting when you have several thousand patterns to deal
 with. Serious effort is made to produce the smallest pattern possible.
 .
 It is also possible to track the original patterns, so that you can
 determine which, among the source patterns that form the assembled
 pattern, was the one that caused the match to occur.
 .
 You should realise that large numbers of alternations are processed
 in perl's regular expression engine in O(n) time, not O(1). If you
 are still having performance problems, you should look at using a
 trie. Note that Perl's own regular expression engine implements
 trie optimisations since perl 5.10. Regexp::Assemble will do the
 right thing when it knows it's running on a trie'd perl.
 (At least in some version after this one).

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: report the search path for a class's ISA tree
 Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived, via
 its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is from
 Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those superclasses may
 themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as
 above).
 .
 When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick->calories), Perl
 first searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it goes
 searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or maybe
 "height-first" is the word) search. In the above example, it'd first look in
 Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life, then
 Chemicals.
 .
 This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the
 list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a method, with
 no duplicates.

    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: read gettext MO files directly, without requiring anything other than PHP
 The GNU gettext library is a widely used localization library, but in
 order to use it with the PHP language, the system has to support the
 desired locale, and library itself must be installed.
 .
 Since this is not always the case, PHP-gettext has been developed to be
 able to read gettext MO files directly, without requiring anything other
 than PHP.
 .
 Currently, it's usable if you develop most of the infrastructure for
 choosing language on your own, because it's possible to use both
 gettext() and ngettext() calls. In the near future, it should also be
 fully compatible drop-in replacement for all of gettext functionality
 written in PHP.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
 ids (UUIDs).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
 space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
 be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
 short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
 across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUID’s, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face
 of large numbers of threads trying to grab UUID’s running on
 different CPU’s. It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen
 program.

 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to

 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.

 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use

 a number of countries).

Description: Advanced Configuration and Power Interface event daemon
 Modern computers support the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)
 to allow intelligent power management on your system and to query battery and
 configuration status.
 .
 ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for delivering
 ACPI events. It listens on netlink interface (or on the deprecated file
 /proc/acpi/event), and when an event occurs, executes programs to handle the
 event. The programs it executes are configured through a set of configuration
 files, which can be dropped into place by packages or by the admin.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 HTML::Template attempts make using HTML templates simple and natural.  It
 extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>,
 <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF> and <TMPL_ELSE>.  The file
 written with HTML and these new tags is called a template.  It is
 usually saved separate from your script - possibly even created by
 someone else!  Using this module you fill in the values for the
 variables, loops and branches declared in the template.  This allows
 you to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you generate
 in the Perl script.
 .
 This module allows you to store its cache in shared memory using the
 IPC::SharedCache module, please install libipc-sharedcache-perl if you
 want to make use of this.

 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful

 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: secure shell (SSH) server, for secure access from remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 sshd replaces the insecure rshd program, which is obsolete for most
 purposes.

Description: Informational list of build-essential packages
 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this

 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

 Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.  It

 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the Debian
 system. You should install this program if your system isn't powered on
 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other Debian packages
 are executed each day.

 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
 Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision
 tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web
 interface, is provided as separate git* packages.

Description: file locking library for Python
 The ‘lockfile’ module exports a ‘FileLock’ class which provides a
 simple API for locking files.
 .
 The appropriate implementation for ‘FileLock’ is chosen automatically
 based on the OS capabilities for an atomic filesystem operation.
 These implementations are also available for explicit use as
 ‘LinkFileLock’ and ‘MkdirFileLock’.
 .
 Other back ends are possible with the same semantics; an example
 provided is ‘SQLiteFileLock’.
 .
 Unlike other Python locking libraries (the Windows ‘msvcrt.locking’
 function, the Unix ‘fcntl.flock’, ‘fcntl.lockf’, and the deprecated
 ‘posixfile’ module), the API is identical across both Unix (including
 GNU/Linux and MacOS) and Windows platforms.

 Cryptsetup is backwards compatible with the on-disk format of cryptoloop,
 but also supports more secure formats. This package includes support for
 automatically configuring encrypted devices at boot time via the config
 file /etc/crypttab. Additional features are cryptoroot support through
 initramfs-tools and several supported ways to read a passphrase or key.

Description: Apache HTTP Server common binary files
 The Apache Software Foundation's goal is to build a secure, efficient and
 extensible HTTP server as standards-compliant open source software. The
 result has long been the number one web server on the Internet.
 .
 This package contains all binaries but no configuration or support scripts.
 To get a stand-alone server, you need to install one of the apache2-mpm-*
 packages, such as worker or prefork. Other packages like gnome-user-share
 may bring their own Apache configuration, though.

 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do some basic daily system
 maintenance tasks. Other packages, such as checksecurity, can provide further
 maintenance tasks.

 This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced

 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"
 or "libevent_core + libevent_extra", the libevent source package builds
 the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and
 libevent_extra.

Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

 .
 Events are received via kernel netlink messaged and processed according to
 rules in /etc/udev/rules.d and /lib/udev/rules.d, altering the name of the
 device node, creating additional symlinks or calling other tools and programs
 including those to load kernel modules and initialise the device.

 This is the client from the Internet Software Consortium's implementation of

 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.
 .
 Extra documentation can be found in the package isc-dhcp-common.

Description: Emulate IO::File interface for in-core strings
 The IO::String module provide the IO::File interface for in-core
 strings.  An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and
 will make it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or
 writing data, as well as seeking to various locations of the string.
 The main reason you might want to do this, is if you have some other
 library module that only provide an interface to file handles, and you
 want to keep all the stuff in memory.
 .
 The IO::String module provide an interface compatible with
 IO::File as distributed with IO-1.20, but the following methods
 are not available; new_from_fd, fdopen, format_write,
 format_page_number, format_lines_per_page, format_lines_left,
 format_name, format_top_name.
